## GENERATING AND STORING A SECRET KEY

1. Navigate to the terminal (Terminal on MacOS, Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, and Terminal in Linux).

2. Use the following command to create a new `secret.txt` file:
   ```
   touch secret.txt
   ```

3. Open the `secret.txt` file using a text editor of your choice. For simplicity, you can use `nano` in terminal:
   ```
   nano secret.txt
   ```

4. Insert the following lines, replacing the placeholders with your actual keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=[insert api key you've generated]
   SECRET_KEY=[insert secret key you've generated]
   ```

5. Save and exit (In `nano`, press `CTRL+O` to write changes, then `CTRL+X` to exit).

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Before using the web app, you must set the following environment variables. If these aren't set, you will receive a 500 error when running the app:

```
export SECRET_KEY=<YourSecretKey>
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YourAPIKey>
export OPENAI_ORG_ID=<YourOrgID>
```

Replace the values inside the angle brackets <> with your actual saved values.

## USING THE WEB APP

   ```
   cd path_to_directory/pdf_bookclub
   ```

2. Run:
   ```
   python3 app.py
   ```

## ABOUT THE APP

This Flask/Jinja web app lets users upload a PDF. Upon upload, the PDF's text is segmented by token number. Each segment has a "generate discussion" button which uses OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 API to stimulate a discussion based on that segment. Note: Clicking "generate discussion" is estimated to cost ~$0.10 per generation from your API account.

Users can also relate passages to their terms using an input box. The "format text ~3" button sends segments to OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 for reformatting, which costs ~$0.10. The "format text (rough)" option doesn't use the API and is free. After selecting "format text (rough)", sentences are highlighted for readability. The right arrow key lets users navigate these sentences.
