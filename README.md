## WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
This is a python app that runs on flask,aand you will host it in your localhost on a web browser. You need to be connected to wi-fi in order for the app to work properly, because in order to generate the bookclub discussions, it needs to make calls to the OpenAI API. Here's examples of what it looks like when it is working:

# GETTING STARTED

## STEP 1 - DO YOU HAVE GIT ON YOUR MACHINE?
You will bring the app onto your machine using Github, so first, you need to make sure you have git installed and its ready to retrieve the files

### SETTING UP THE LOCAL REPOSITORY

1. Open your terminal.

2. Create a directory/folder for the project using:
   ```
   mkdir pdf_bookclub
   ```

3. Navigate into the directory you just created:
   ```
   cd pdf_bookclub
   ```

4. Clone the git repository: 
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:garrettstephens11/pdf_bookclub.git
   ```

If you encounter git issues, (or do not have it at all yet) please visit https://chat.openai.com for assistance, and ask Chat GPT "please walk me through setting up git on my machine"

### VERIFYING GIT SETUP

1. Open your terminal anew
2.
   ```
   cd pdf_bookclub
   ```
3. `Check if you are connected to the remote repository.
    ```
   git remote -v
   ```
6. Verify the status of your repository.
    ```
   git status
   ```
8. If local doesn't match remote:
   ```
   git pull origin main
   ```
4. Ensure sync:
   ```
   git pull origin main
   ```
You should see "Everything up-to-date".

## STEP 2 - DO YOU HAVE OPENAI API?
If not, you need to check a few things

1. Visit platform.openai.com
2. Create an account, or sign in if you already have an account
3. Go back to platform.openai.com
4. Check that you have an "Organization" and an "Organization ID". You will need this information to use the API to get PDF Bookclub going

5. Check that you have generated a key for OpenAI API

![Screenshot from 2024-03-31 20-55-50](https://github.com/garrettstephens11/pdf_bookclub/assets/132736118/cfc487df-b602-4a8b-b8ed-d4fd1f61d184)

6. If you have not generated a key, click the button to generate the key, name it whatever you like, and save it in some text/.txt file, from which you will copy and paste in the future for the app

7. Check that you have a payment card on your Billing account for OpenAI API. For reference, if you use PDF Bookclub for several hours, it should cost you only around ~$1, but you will be able to track your spending via the "usage" tab on platform.openai.com ...

8. Suggested amount to get started is to select to add $10 to your account's "credit balance". Then you can see how much you use PDF Bookclub and how much you're spending in order to use it 

## STEP 3 - GENERATING AND STORING A "SECRET KEY" ON YOUR MACHINE
Next, we will generate and store what is called a "secret key" for your access to the app on your machine. After this step you will have three things to keep track of (1) your OpenAI API Key (2) your OpenAI Org ID and (3) your "Secret Key"

1. Open your terminal anew (Terminal on MacOS, Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, and Terminal in Linux).
2. Make sure you are in the app directory 
   ```
   cd pdf_bookclub
   ```

3. Use the following command to create a new `secret.txt` file:
   ```
   touch secret.txt
   ```

4. Open the `secret.txt` file using a text editor of your choice. For simplicity, you can use `nano` in terminal:
   ```
   nano secret.txt
   ```

5. Insert the following lines, replacing the placeholders with your actual keys:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=[insert secret key you've generated]
   ```

   You have two choices for what your secret key is (1) use the same key as your OpenAI API Key which you've saved into a text file already, or (2) generate a new authentic complex key, save it in a separate text file and then put that complex string in as your secret key. Just make sure you know where the two files are on your machine, (1) the text file that contains your OpenAI API Key and (2) the text file that contains your Secret Key

6. Save and exit (In your terminal in `nano`, press `CTRL+O` to write changes, then `CTRL+X` to exit).

## STEP 4 - INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES

1. Open terminal window anew
2. Make sure you're in the app directory
   
   ```
   cd pdf_bookclub
   ```

### ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Before using the web app, you must set the following environment variables. If these aren't set, you will receive a 500 error when running the app:

```
export SECRET_KEY=<YourSecretKey>
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YourAPIKey>
export OPENAI_ORG_ID=<YourOrgID>
```

Replace the values inside the angle brackets <> with your actual saved values.


## USING THE WEB APP

1. In your terminal, navigate to the directory of the project:
   ```
   cd path_to_directory/pdf_bookclub
   ```

2. Run:
   ```
   python3 app.py
   ```

## ABOUT THE APP

This Flask/Jinja web app lets users upload a PDF. Upon upload, the PDF's text is segmented by token number. Each segment has a "generate discussion" button which uses OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 API to stimulate a discussion based on that segment. Note: Clicking "generate discussion" is estimated to cost ~$0.10 per generation from your API account.

Users can also relate passages to their terms using an input box. The "format text ~3" button sends segments to OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 for reformatting, which costs ~$0.10. The "format text (rough)" option doesn't use the API and is free. After selecting "format text (rough)", sentences are highlighted for readability. The right arrow key lets users navigate these sentences.

Enjoy PDF Book Club!
